Then go through the problems at the end of the chapter to further reinforce concepts from the chapter and the material in the readings. Finally compare answers with classmates and look for alternative ways to come to the same conclusion or resolve a problem. Look to online videos as needed to solidify material further if there are still difficulties in comprehension. Make sure that you have worked all of the chapter problems as a group before the end of the session.  Write down a summary of everything learned at the end of the session to use as a study reference for Day 90 material at the end of this entire session.  At that time, you can look at how much you've progressed over the course of this 90 day learning session. Also reflect on any mistakes and misunderstandings to help reinforce the correct procedures and thought-processes to arrive at solutions and understanding the material and concepts. Then be sure to write down any follow up questions or issues to explore in session 2 or during the assigned breaks. Then be prepared to share these results at the start of Session 2 for today. Finally be sure to reflect on anything you might have missed or did not fully understand. This can also be noted to discuss with the online resources as well as your study partners so that you can fully grasp the core concepts of the class material being taught on Day 1 of 90."

Think about all of the possible alternatives, even if they are not necessarily the best ways to use the material. Write down everything you can think of to share later with the group and on the online forums as well. Share with the study group and get additional ideas of how to use the materials being taught. Take a break at the end of the session, before the next session. You will want to recharge your brain with some activity that is not cognitively demanding.

Define all key terminologies related to the study subject selected.) Research foundational theories/techniques associated with your primary study subject. Summarize key definitions to reference later. Be prepared to answer all core 'what is' questions related to your selected subject. Take detailed notes on the topics. All definitions, theories, techniques, methodologies, and processes should be clearly understood and ready to be recalled for later application. A good command of definitions is essential for mastering the subject of interest. All concepts, theories, and definitions must be studied until an 80% recall accuracy is obtained through self-testing. Focus on understanding, not just memorization.) . [Use flashcards for later recall review]. Focus on long-term memory storage through mental-association techniques such as acronyms, mnemonic devices, concept diagrams, etc. Utilize memory improvement techniques in order to promote long-term recall, especially when preparing for examinations.) Focus on the most frequently tested theories/concepts, if preparing for an examination. The initial session is critical because the initial concepts will act as pillars to support complex topics later on in the study schedule. Be prepared to recall all basic definitions from memory, without the use of external resources. Write a brief personal summary of the information learned during the session to ensure long-term information storage through writing and recall. Summaries are not verbatim copying; instead, they focus on key concepts that act as triggers for the recall of comprehensive information. Note any open questions that you may have at the end of each session. Resolve these questions during dedicated research sessions or with the help of a mentor/instructor/teacher. This ensures continued topic clarity and prevents future misunderstanding of the subject. A brief study-break should be taken once every 30 minutes during lectures/readings, to promote subject retention (5 minutes). This will result in a more effective use of study time and the information will be more easily stored in the long-term memory. Don't study until you are tired. Rest and continue later, instead. This will make the material stick much better in your memory, resulting in faster, more effective learning. Also, it helps to avoid 'burning out' during intense study schedules. Review and recall the subject definitions prior to each study session. This will help reinforce the information learned and promote recall during the next session. Note: Study sessions should focus on active recall rather than passive reading. Active recall is a superior method of learning which results in more efficient learning overall. It is more effective than passive reading because the material is being mentally 'worked with'. Passive reading is simply 'glancing over' the text and hoping that something will stick in the brain. Use active learning techniques to maximize the return-on-investment (ROI) of the time investment made in each study session. Examples of active recall include flashcard memorization, question/answer sessions, verbal teaching, writing summaries from memory, etc. Review and recall all notes within 24 hours of the session to promote long-term memory storage. This also allows for a reduction in the forgetting curve (a.k.a., 'Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve'). This prevents the information from being lost and promotes long-term understanding of the material. Actively seek to identify associations and connections within the material studied during each session. Learning should be an iterative process whereby new knowledge builds upon previous knowledge. Try to see the 'big picture'. In the event that certain theories or definitions are unclear, it is critical that you seek clarification from a teacher, mentor, or external study resources (e.g., the internet) as soon as possible. Unclear definitions can quickly degrade the efficiency of future study sessions. All ambiguities must be addressed immediately as they arise. Note: If preparing for an examination, seek to identify the key information that is most likely to appear on the exam. There is no use in focusing on obscure knowledge that will not be assessed during an examination. Prepare and review all study materials regularly (e.g., flashcards) until you obtain an 80% recall percentage. Regular study of flashcard definitions is highly recommended to promote long-term retention of the material. Review flashcards in a random order to ensure that you are actually memorizing the material, and not just memorizing the sequential order in which the material is presented. Flashcards are a fast and effective method of remembering facts and definitions, if used properly. Create a glossary of terms to allow for rapid review of terminologies at any time. Glossaries should be actively reviewed for 5-10 minutes prior to each study session to ensure that the information is clear in your mind. If you can remember key terms, theories, and definitions for each subject without the need for external resources, you will be able to learn at a far more rapid pace than individuals who do not take the time to memorize core terms. Memorization allows the mind to fully focus on synthesis, analysis, and application of the information. Without memorization, the mind is distracted by looking up definitions in external resources. All memorization should be completed using active-recall techniques for long-term retention. If possible, take study session notes by hand, instead of by computer. This technique will promote long-term memorization of the subject because you will be physically writing the information. By comparison, typing notes on a computer is simply an exercise in data entry and it does not necessarily mean that you are committing the information to memory. Handwritten notes result in greater subject retention and recall. This study technique is especially useful when preparing for university-level examinations. The information will be more deeply embedded in your mind and you will have a greater understanding of the subject overall. Create study aids from memory instead of simply copying information from a book. Memory-based study aids reinforce the concepts in the mind. Teach the subject to someone, instead of simply reciting the facts. This is the best method of determining whether you actually understand the subject. It also promotes the long-term storage of information because you must be able to verbalize the information. If you find yourself 'stuck', you will have a clear indication of what terms or concepts you do not fully understand. Review your study schedule at the end of each study session to prepare yourself for the next session. This will prime your brain for learning during the next session and will reduce the amount of time required to prepare. Review and recall the previous study session prior to each study session to ensure that the concepts remain clear in your mind. By reviewing the materials regularly, you will be able to recall them at any time in the future. It is also useful to keep a 'Notes' document on your computer to record ideas, insights, summaries, personal notes, questions, points of research, and all other useful information. This 'Notes' document becomes a comprehensive, easily-searchable record of everything you have learned during your study schedule. You can quickly reference anything you have studied in the past. This method is especially useful for university students and researchers. Always be wary of confusing correlation with causation. It is important that you fully understand why something is related to something else. Don't just assume that a causal connection exists. Instead, seek to clearly understand how the entities are connected. Also, always be aware of your personal biases and seek to minimize them when analyzing information. Remember that you can't solve problems using the same thinking that created them. The best solutions often arise from a fresh perspective or approach. Be open to new ideas and new ways of thinking about a problem. Keep asking 'why' until you obtain a clear understanding of the answer. Ask questions and seek out knowledge. Don't just accept things as being true without first considering the context and evidence. The best learners are those who have an insatiable curiosity and desire to learn more. Approach each problem with an open and inquisitive mind. Think critically about all new information. Make sure that new ideas are aligned with your existing understanding of the subject. Question new information that does not make sense and seek to find new information from external resources. Don't simply accept things as being true; verify that they are true using reliable external resources. A healthy amount of skepticism is useful during the learning process. Avoid 'group think' and focus on forming your own independent opinions based upon facts and data. Always seek to learn the truth, even if it conflicts with popular beliefs or opinion. Don't blindly trust 'experts' without verifying their statements and claims. Verify information by cross-referencing multiple independent sources to confirm accuracy. Be especially wary of accepting opinions presented on social media or Internet forums. The most accurate information will be typically presented in the form of scholarly articles or scientific papers. Use these sources to verify facts and data obtained elsewhere. It is critical that you develop the ability to distinguish facts from opinions. Opinions are usually based on feelings or emotions, whereas facts are based on observation or data. A statement of fact can be verified using external sources, whereas a statement of opinion cannot. You should base your conclusions on facts, not opinions. Avoid the use of logical fallacies and make sure that you fully understand the context of new information. A logical fallacy is a flaw in reasoning which results in an invalid argument. These fallacies are often used unintentionally. Be aware of the most common logical fallacies and avoid their use in your personal reasoning. Take time to understand the study schedule at the beginning of the day. Mentally prepare yourself for the topics that you will be covering during the day. Review your schedule, prepare your study area, and ensure that you have all of the external resources required to learn effectively. Make sure that you have a comfortable study environment, with minimal distractions. The goal is to focus your attention on learning for a specific period of time, so minimize anything that can detract from this. Keep the temperature moderate, the light bright, and the noise level low. Ensure that you have a comfortable chair, a stable desk, and all of the required external resources nearby. This will ensure that your learning environment is optimal, and that you are not distracted by minor issues. Always have a water bottle nearby to maintain hydration. Take the time to prepare your body and mind for an effective study session. It is far better to begin a study session with the ideal preparation. Prioritize sleep, nutrition, and exercise to promote effective learning. Get plenty of sleep prior to a study session so that you can perform at your best. Avoid junk foods and eat healthy snacks. Stay hydrated and exercise regularly to promote brain function. These are important components of a successful study schedule. It is important that you review all course material and syllabi, in advance, to ensure that you are familiar with all information that is expected of you during your study schedule. You should review the topics that will be covered in class and do some preliminary research in advance. This will prepare you for the topic and promote greater understanding during the course. This will also allow you to ask intelligent questions and gain a deeper understanding of the material. Make sure that you are familiar with all requirements and expectations for the course. Reviewing the course materials in advance is an excellent way to prepare for a new subject and to maximize your learning potential. Avoid multi-tasking. Instead, focus on one task at a time. Studies have shown that multi-tasking reduces productivity and can lead to mistakes. Instead, focus on the task at hand and complete it before moving on to the next task. This will help you to stay focused and to avoid distractions. Try to complete tasks one at a time and avoid jumping back and forth between tasks. The goal is to stay in the zone and to maintain concentration. Minimize interruptions from email, social media, and phone calls. Focus on the task at hand and dedicate your full attention to it. You will be more productive and you will be less likely to make mistakes. It is better to do one thing well than to do many things poorly. Always strive for excellence and focus on producing high-quality work. Take pride in your work and strive to do your best. This will help you to stay motivated and to achieve your goals. Focus on the quality of your work and not just the quantity. It is far better to produce a few high-quality pieces of work than to produce many low-quality pieces. Take the time to review your work and make sure that it is accurate and complete. You will be more satisfied with your work if you take the time to do it right. It is also useful to reward yourself upon completion of certain study goals. A small reward can help to maintain motivation and to promote a sense of accomplishment. The reward could be something as simple as taking a break, watching a movie, or eating a snack. Just make sure that the reward is something that you enjoy and that it is not detrimental to your health. Rewards can be a powerful tool to help you stay motivated and to achieve your goals. Set realistic expectations for yourself. Don't expect to be able to learn everything overnight. Learning takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself and don't get discouraged if you don't see results immediately. Just keep working at it and you will eventually achieve your goals. It is important to set realistic goals that you can actually achieve. This will help you to stay motivated and to avoid disappointment. Don't try to do too much too soon. Start with small goals and gradually increase the difficulty. You will be more likely to succeed if you take things one step at a time. Remember to celebrate your successes along the way. This will help you to stay motivated and to continue learning. Avoid trying to rush through material in order to save time. Instead, focus on learning the information as deeply as possible. This will help you to understand the material better and to retain it for longer. It is better to learn something well than to learn it quickly. Instead, focus on understanding and retention. This will help you to succeed in the long run. Take the time to learn the material properly and you will be rewarded with a deeper understanding and greater retention. Avoid distractions and focus on the task at hand. This will help you to learn the material more effectively. It is better to focus on one task at a time than to try to multi-task. Find a quiet place to study and minimize interruptions. Turn off your phone and close any unnecessary programs on your computer. The goal is to create a focused learning environment where you can concentrate on the material. By avoiding distractions, you will be able to learn more effectively and retain the information for longer."

Define all key terminologies related to the study subject selected.) Research foundational theories/techniques associated with your primary study subject. Summarize key definitions to reference later. Be prepared to answer all core 'what is' questions related to your selected subject. Take detailed notes on the topics. All definitions, theories, techniques, methodologies, and processes should be clearly understood and ready to be recalled for later application. A good command of definitions is essential for mastering the subject of interest. All concepts, theories, and definitions must be studied until an 80% recall accuracy is obtained through self-testing. Focus on understanding, not just memorization.) . [Use flashcards for later recall review]. Focus on long-term memory storage through mental-association techniques such as acronyms, mnemonic devices, concept diagrams, etc. Utilize memory improvement techniques in order to promote long-term recall, especially when preparing for examinations.) Focus on the most frequently tested theories/concepts, if preparing for an examination. The initial session is critical because the initial concepts will act as pillars to support complex topics later on in the study schedule. Be prepared to recall all basic definitions from memory, without the use of external resources. Write a brief personal summary of the information learned during the session to ensure long-term information storage through writing and recall. Summaries are not verbatim copying; instead, they focus on key concepts that act as triggers for the recall of comprehensive information. Note any open questions that you may have at the end of each session. Resolve these questions during dedicated research sessions or with the help of a mentor/instructor/teacher. This ensures continued topic clarity and prevents future misunderstanding of the subject. A brief study-break should be taken once every 30 minutes during lectures/readings, to promote subject retention (5 minutes). This will result in a more effective use of study time and the information will be more easily stored in the long-term memory. Don't study until you are tired. Rest and continue later, instead. This will make the material stick much better in your memory, resulting in faster, more effective learning. Also, it helps to avoid 'burning out' during intense study schedules.
